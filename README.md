# theMetAPI

This project uses the Metropolitan Museum of Art's API for searching items in its collection. 

Users enter key words in the search bar, and the website uses API calls to curate the top most relevant items in the collection to those key words.
The website is reponsive to mobile devices and desktop users using CSS grid.
